# GOAT Bitvm2 Node
A universal node for Operator, Challenger and Covenant Signer.

## Tutorial

See [Node](node/README.md).

## Roles

There are three main roles in this protocol, Committee, Operator and Challenger.

| Role       | Functions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Committee  | N-of-n signers for the presign transactions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Operator   | Anyone can be an operator. <br>1. Exchange PeggleBTC to native BTC with users <br>2. Kickoff the reimbursement from Committee <br> 3. Generate the preimage of the hash time lock to each watchtower <br>4. Exchange PegBTC to BTC with end-user via AtomicSwap                            |
| Challenger | Anyone can be a challenger <br>1. Verify the valid of the reimbursement from operators offchain <br>2. Submit the challenge transaction on Bitcoin to force the kick off to unhappy path                                                                                                   
| Watchtower | A special kind of challenger, selected from the Sequencer candidates, maintains the longest chain headers and spends the Watchtower output of the Kickoff transaction.                                                                                                                     
| Verifier   | Another kind of challenger. Once the kickoff is on the unhappy path, and the operator unveils all the execution trace(Circuit F below), verify finds the flow in the execution trace, and can spend the UTXO from Assert transaction, and stop the operator to continue the reimbursement.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Committee 
    participant O as Operator
    participant B as Bitcoin Network
    participant L2 as Layer 2

    U->>B: Broadcast incomplete Peg-in tx
    F->>All: Generate & broadcast keypair + Musig2 Nonce
    O->>F: Generate BitVM2 tx graph & Presign Challenge 
    F->>All: Presign Take1/Take2/Disprove/Assert tx
    U->>B: Sign & broadcast pegin tx
    Note over B: Transaction confirmation
    F->>L2: Submit pegin txid & graph info
```

### Kick-Off

```mermaid

    participant O as Operator
    participant B as Bitcoin Network
    participant L2 as Layer 2

    O->>L2: initWithdraw tx (lock pegBTC & UTXO)
    Note over L2: Broadcast initWithdraw txid
    O->>B: Sign & broadcast Kickoff tx
    Note over B: Transaction confirmation
    O->>L2: Submit Kickoff tx

        O->>B: After challenge period, broadcast Take-2
        O->>A: Broadcast Take-2
        O->>L2: Submit Take-2
    end
    Note over L2: Update state
```

## Node 

### Run a node

```bash
./target/debug/goat-bitvm2-node
```
It should print out the address to listen on.

In another console, run 
```bash
./target/debug/goat-bitvm2-node /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/50022
```
Replace the peer address with above.

#### Operation
**Requirement** 

Committee Member: need approval from all committee members

Challenger: anyone can be a challenger

Operator: anyone who holds PeggledBTC can be an operator 

**Operation**

1. Generate identity
2. Configure the bootnode and launch the node

**Unjoin**

#### Identity and Authentication

Generate the identity by cli.

P2P: ed25519

Committee n-of-n: musig2 (secp256k1)
